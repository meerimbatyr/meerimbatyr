Hi I am  Meerim Batyrkanova, a passionate self-taught fron-end developer currently based in Qatar.  I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast who constantly learns from open-source community, which I truly admire and appreciate the collaboration and knowledge-sharing happening there.
